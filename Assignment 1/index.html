<p>Don't you ever just feel like watching a movie that makes you feel terrified about the state of the world and the future? Something that makes you wish fiction didn't reflect reality so closely?
Well then, we've got a treat for you. The Day After Tomorrow is exactly the kind of film that will make you wish climate change were fiction and not a reality breathing down on our necks as we refuse to regulate the companies that are bringing about ecological destruction. Too real? Well, my bbs, buckle up.</p>

<h2>Giant hail is so terrifying in part because we've already started getting larger and larger sizes of hail in Colorado.</h2>
<img class="img-2" src="storm.jpg" alt="storm">
<h2>I'm actually shocked at how well the special effects in this hold up. These tornadoes look real AF.</h2>
